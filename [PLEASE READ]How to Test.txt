pPlease ignore the files in 'tests' folder, they don't work anymore
Instead, just run game.py, player.py, and score.py files.
When they are run as the main function, they will test themselves automatically.
If you know Mahjong, feel free to do your own test cases.
Whether you know it or not, please read the comments near my own test cases.
